        <p>I am the middle child with two half-sisters, we all share the same mother. I have never had the pleasure of meeting my father. Was born in a small town in the south western part of Colorado in the year 1964. My mother’s mother has been found to be a descendant of two brothers who have helped create this country by signing both the Declarations of Independence and the Constitution of the United States.</p>
        <p>Grew up on the pore side of life and lived like nomads from the day I was born until I graduated high school. Though I was not a very good student I did have my moments from writing about 350 poems with only a couple published in my junior high years. I explored theater for several years off and on with stage special effects and lighting, drama, musicals and even did an operetta.
                During this time, I developed the desire and aptitude for mechanical and architectural skills and creativity. All while I had to pay bills so, from the age of 14 to present time I have had over 70 plus jobs. Some of which was doing virtually the same thing for different companies.</p>
                <p>From working on a mink and oyster farm, 16 years in restaurants to include training under a French Chef. Worked as a semi tire man while doing hot recaps, worked as a draftsman and a kitchen designer installer, have done sales like Fuller Brush, Avon, Amway, water purification, commercial utilities and even office and computer equipment. Have done work for and Aerial Mapping Company, mapping U.S. Cities and U.S. Military bases around the world. Worked for a county for 10 years as a Draftsman, Inspector I & II and as a Capital Projects Civil Engineer all without a degree. Received an Associates Network of Science Degree then worked on a global server migration project for 2 major global companies. For the past 7 years have worked in the Drug Rehab field as a Program Monitor, Kitchen Manager/Head Cook and currently the Administrative Coordinator. </p>

    <h2 style="color: green;">My travels</h2>
    <img class="larger-image thick-green-border" src="file:///Users/admin/Desktop/traveling.jpg" alt="Traveling the world">
    <p>I have had the pleasure of living and traveling all over most of the United States at one time or another. Have been as far West as Maui, as far East as Barcelona Spain and Switzerland, as far North as the East and West coast of Canada and as far South as the Bahamas. Have lived in the Rockies of Colorado to the beaches of Florida, California, Organ and Washington State. Have been near the eruption of Mount St. Hellen’s and deep inside of NORAD twice.
            My personal thirst of knowledge is not any less dramatic than the rest of my life, it is also part of my hobby skills.</p>
